## üîπAdvanced

### üîπ Branching & Merging

```bash
git merge --no-ff <branch>    # Merge without fast-forward (preserve branch history)
git merge --squash <branch>   # Merge branch as a single commit
git rebase <branch>           # Rebase current branch onto another
git rebase -i <commit>        # Interactive rebase for editing commits
git cherry-pick <commit>      # Apply specific commit to current branch
git branch --contains <commit> # Show branches containing a commit
git reflog                    # Show all actions and HEAD changes
```

### Git Merge vs Git Rebase

`git merge` combines the histories of two branches into one.

```
A---B---C---------M
         \       /
          D-----E
```

**Pros**

- Preserves the true history of how development happened.
- Safe for collaborative work‚Äîhistory remains intact.
- Easy to see when branches were merged.

**Cons**

- History can get messy with many merge commits.
- Harder to read linear progression of commits.

`git rebase` moves or ‚Äúreplays‚Äù commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history.

Git rewrites the feature branch commits D and E, putting them on top of main:

```
A---B---C---D'---E'
```

- The original commits D and E are replaced by D' and E' with new hashes.

**Pros**

- Produces clean, linear history.
- Easier to read and navigate with git log.
- Ideal for small feature branches before merging into main.

**Cons**

- Rewrites history‚Äîdangerous if the branch is already pushed/shared.
- Can cause conflicts that need to be resolved manually for each commit.

### üîπ Undo / History Editing

```bash
git reset --mixed <commit>    # Reset HEAD, keep working directory
git reset --keep <commit>     # Reset while keeping uncommitted changes that do not conflict
git revert -n <commit>        # Revert without committing immediately
git commit --amend             # Modify the last commit (message or content)
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf <file>' HEAD # Remove a file from history
git rebase --onto <newbase> <upstream> <branch>     # Move branch onto another base
```

`git revert` ‚Äì ‚ÄúUndo by creating a new commit‚Äù

_Suppose your commit history looks like this:_

```
A --- B --- C   (HEAD)
```

_You want to undo commit B_:
`git revert B`

- Git creates a new commit (say D) that reverses the changes made in B

```
A --- B --- C --- D
```

- **Note**: Nothing is removed from history; the undo is recorded as a new commit.

`git reset` ‚Äì ‚ÄúMove HEAD to an earlier commit‚Äù

- Moves the current branch pointer (HEAD) to a previous commit.
- Can optionally **keep or discard** changes in your working directory and
  staging area.
- Rewrites history, so **dangerous on shared branches**.

**Types of reset** \
`--soft` Moves HEAD to commit and
Keeps staged changes (index) \
`--mixed (default)` Moves HEAD and Unstages changes but keeps them in working directory \
`--hard` Moves HEAD and Discard all changes in working directory and staging

**Example**

_Commit history:_

```
A --- B --- C   (HEAD)
```

- Soft reset to `B`:

```bash
git reset --soft B # HEAD moves to B. Changes from C remain staged.
```

- Hard reset to `B`:

```bash
git reset --hard B # HEAD moves to B. Changes from C are gone completely.
```

### üîπStashing & Work-in-Progress

```bash
git stash save "message"       # Save changes with message
git stash branch <branch>      # Create branch from stash
git stash apply stash@{n}      # Apply specific stash
git stash drop stash@{n}       # Drop specific stash
git stash clear                # Drop all stashes
```

### Git Stash

Git Stash is a way to temporarily save changes in your working directory that you are not ready to commit yet. It‚Äôs like putting your changes in a ‚Äúdrawer‚Äù so you can switch branches or work on something else without losing your work.

**Why use Git Stash?**

- You‚Äôre working on a feature but need to switch branches to fix a bug.
- You have unfinished changes but don‚Äôt want to commit a messy or incomplete state.
- You want to test something quickly without committing the current changes.

Git will allow the switch only if the changes do not conflict with files in other branch. That's why git stash becomes important on stashing your changes it cleans your working directory allowing you to switch branches ( even in conflicts ) and do changes come back and apply the temporarily saved code.

### üîπRemote & Collaboration

```bash
git remote show origin         # Show remote details
git fetch --all                # Fetch all remotes
git pull --rebase              # Rebase instead of merge when pulling
git push --force-with-lease    # Force push safely
git push --tags                # Push all tags
git remote prune origin        # Remove deleted remote branches
```

### üîπDiff & Log Analysis

```bash
git diff <commit1> <commit2>       # Compare two commits
git diff --stat                     # Show summary of changes
git diff --name-only                # Show only changed file names
git log --stat                       # Commit log with file stats
git log --since="2 weeks ago"       # Filter log by date
git log --author="Author Name"      # Filter by author
git blame <file>                    # Show last modification per line
```
